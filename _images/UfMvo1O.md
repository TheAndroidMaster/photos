description: As I said, the ThinkPad definitely complements this tomb. Its powerful LED ThinkLight illuminates the surrounding area well, perfect for writing some free and open source software to automate some pre&#8208;burial tasks. As you can see, I have laid the ThinkPad on a used Sainsbury's plastic bag to avoid any damage to the floor from the carefully designed grippy feet of its 94Wh extended slice battery.
